## Production



## Scaling Event Listeners

To scale event listeners, each guild must register their own Moralis account and add the event listeners to their smart contracts. It would be nice to hook it up to Twitter or email, but for now we can call it pub()

1. ğŸ“¦ Guild initializes token
    i. ğŸ“¦ Gets whitelisted to use make a guild token
    ii. ğŸ“¦ guildDao calls `GuildFactory.createGuild()` and gets token contract address
2. ğŸ“¦ Guild registers for Moralis
    i. ğŸ“¦ Add Moralis event listeners for their `GuildToken.sol`: minting, acl, etc
    ii. ğŸ“¦ Add event listeners to their manual testing checklist
3. ğŸ“¦ Guild initializes crowdsale
    i. ğŸ“¦ Gets whitelisted to make a crowdsale
    ii. ğŸ“¦ guildDao calls `CrowdSaleFactory.createCrowdSale()` and gets crowdsale contract address
    iii. ğŸ“¦ Add Moralis event listeners for their `CrowdSale.sol`: purchase, et
4. ğŸ“¦ GuildFX webhook captures guild events
    i. ğŸ“¦ Saves event data into GCloud/guild_events
    ii. ğŸ“¦ Updates state data in Firestore/guild
