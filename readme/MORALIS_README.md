# Moralis Readme

## Connect Moralis MongoDB to Retool

Use the below database connection string as a Retool resource.

```
mongodb://mongodb0.example.com:27017/admin
```

Find the IP:port in the Moralis Server Details. It will look something like one of the below:

```
mongodb://138.197.134.56:56728
mongodb://138.197.134.56:56728/database
```

We are not sure yet, as Retool says it is connected, but cant actually read any of the data.
